        <h2>THE BAND</h2>
         <p id="about-band-p">Kansas is an American rock band that became popular in the 1970s initially on album-oriented
             rock charts and later with hit singles such as "Carry On Wayward Son" and "Dust in the Wind".
              The band has produced nine gold albums, three multi-platinum albums (Leftoverture 6x, Point of Know Return 4x,
               The Best of Kansas 4x), one other platinum studio album (Monolith), one platinum live double album (Two for the Show),
                and a million-selling single, "Dust in the Wind". Kansas appeared on the Billboard charts for over 200 weeks
                throughout the 1970s and 1980s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan.
                 "Carry On Wayward Son" was the second-most-played track on US classic rock radio in 1995 and No. 1 in 1997.

        <h2>Best album</h2>
        <p>The Best of Kansas is the first compilation album from the American progressive rock band Kansas.<br>
             It was originally released in 1984, and featured one new track, "Perfect Lover", written by then-lead<br>
              vocalist John Elefante and his brother Dino Elefante. The compilation was re-released in 1999 in a <br>
              version supervised by the original band members, so "Perfect Lover" was dropped in favor of three additional <br>
              tracks to make it fit on a single CD. Added were "The Pinnacle" from Masque, "The Devil Game" from Song<br>
               for America, and a live track deleted from Two for the Show called "Closet Chronicles", originally from Point <br>
               of Know Return. The album has sold over 4 million copies in the United States and was certified quadruple platinum in 2001.<br>
               <br>
        The versions of "Carry On Wayward Son" and "The Wall" on the 1984 release of The Best of Kansas are specially remixed<br>
         versions unique to the first version of this collection. For the 1999 reissue of the collection, the original 1976 mixes<br>
          from the album Leftoverture are used instead. The removal of "Perfect Lover" which had previously been available only on<br>
           this album, makes the track out of print in the United States. The original track listing and mixes were restored for<br>
            the 2014 180-gram vinyl release of the album by Friday Music.</p>
