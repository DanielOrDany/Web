                    You may well ask: “How can I start using HTML5 if older browsers don’t support it?” But
                    the question itself is misleading. HTML5 is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual
                    features. So you can’t detect “HTML5 support,” because that doesn’t make any sense. But
                    you can detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.

                    </br>
                    You may think of HTML as tags and angle brackets. That’s an important part of it, but it’s not the whole story.
                    The HTML5 specification also defines how those angle brackets interact with JavaScript, 
                    through the Document Object Model (DOM). HTML5 doesn’t just define a <<code>video</code>> tag; 
                    there is also a corresponding DOM API for video objects in the DOM. You can use this API 
                    to detect support for different video formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how 
                    much of the video has been downloaded, and everything else you need to build a rich user 
                    experience around the <<code>video</code>> tag itself.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 2</span> and <span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Appendix A</span> will teach you how to properly detect support for each new HTML5 feature.

            <h2 class="content-title">2. You don’t need to throw anything away</h2>
            <div class="subtitle-content">
                <img id="second-title-img" src="http://diveintohtml5.info/i/forms.png" width="134px" height="196px">

                    Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that HTML 4 is the most successful markup format ever.
                    HTML5 builds on that success. You don’t need to throw away your existing markup. 
                    You don’t need to relearn things you already know. If your web application worked 
                    yesterday in HTML 4, it will still work today in HTML5. Period.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Now, if you want to improve your web applications, you’ve come to the right place.
                    Here’s a concrete example: HTML5 supports all the form controls from HTML 4,
                    but it also includes new input controls. Some of these are long-overdue additions 
                    like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle. For example, the email
                    input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize 
                    their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type email addresses. 
                    Older browsers that don’t support the email input type will treat it as a
                    regular text field, and the form still works with no markup changes or
                    scripting hacks. This means you can start improving your web forms today,
                    even if some of your visitors are stuck on IE 6.

            <h2 class="content-title">3. It’s easy to get started</h2>
            <div class="subtitle-content">

                    “Upgrading” to HTML5 can be as simple as changing your doctype. 
                    The doctype should already be on the first line of every HTML page.
                    Previous versions of HTML defined a lot of doctypes, and choosing the
                    right one could be tricky. In HTML5, there is only one doctype:
                    <<code>!DOCTYPE html</code>>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Upgrading to the HTML5 doctype won’t break your existing markup, 
                    because  <span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">obsolete elements</span> previously defined in HTML 4 will still 
                    render in HTML5. But it will allow you to use — and validate — new
                    semantic elements like <<code>article</code>>, <<code>section</code>>, <<code>header</code>>, and <<code>footer</code>>.
                    You’ll learn all about these new elements in  <span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 3</span>.
            
                </p>

            <h2 class="content-title">4. It already works</h2>
            <div class="subtitle-content">

                    Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, 
                    or build web applications that work offline, you’ll find that HTML5 is
                    already well-supported. Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers
                    already support canvas (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 4</span>), 
                    video (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 5</span>), 
                    geolocation (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 6</span>),
                    local storage (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 7</span>), 
                    and more. Google already supports microdata 
                    annotations (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 10</span>). 
                    Even Microsoft — rarely known for blazing the trail
                    of standards support — supports most HTML5 features in Internet Explorer 9.

                    Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser compatibility
                    charts. But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank discussion of your
                    options if you need to support older browsers. HTML5 features like geolocation 
                    (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 6</span>)
                     and video (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 5</span>)
                      were first provided by browser plugins like 
                    Gears or Flash. Other features, like canvas
                     (<span style="color: FireBrick; border-bottom: 1px dotted;">Chapter 4</span>), can be emulated 
                    entirely in JavaScript. This book will teach you how to target the native 
                    features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

                    Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s.
                    He later founded the W3C to act as a steward of web standards, which
                    the organization has done for more than 15 years. Here is what the W3C had 
                    to say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:
                 
                    <p style="font-size: large; margin: 1.556em 0; margin-left: 28px;">
                    Today the Director announces that when the XHTML 2 Working Group charter
                    expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. 
                    By doing so, and by increasing resources in the HTML Working Group, W3C hopes 
                    to accelerate the progress of HTML5 and clarify W3C’s position regarding the future of HTML.
